My program implements a modified A* algorithm with a hash table that stores
visited nodes. It also uses Euclidean distance instead of Manhattan distance
in its heuristic.

It is complete, and should work for any nXn puzzle to the point that the
machine runs out of memory or the person sitting at it in CSIL turns it off.
Note in the Runfile that it reads from STDIN and writes to STDOUT so file
redirection is necessary.
